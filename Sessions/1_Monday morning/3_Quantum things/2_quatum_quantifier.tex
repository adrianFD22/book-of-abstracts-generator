\abstracttitle{Quantum quantumness and the quantum quantifier}

\firstauthor{Michael M. Williams}{University of Andorra}

\abstracttext{
    New tools are required for solving the new problems the post-quantum era introduces. Some authors are of the opinion that the fundamentals of mathematics itselves have to be reformulated in order to overcome the difficulties quantum computers introduces. This is because post-quantum era will need us to do sacrifices. For helping overcoming the quantum era, I am eating healthier and having a more regular sleep routine. If you start eating from 6 to 8000 calories a day, you will experience a great change in you life and quantum problems will not be able to bother you. You will feel more energetic, you will be able to see in the dark and you will won the lottery one in 3 three times. For helping you to digest this, I am repeating this paragraph exactly in the same way
