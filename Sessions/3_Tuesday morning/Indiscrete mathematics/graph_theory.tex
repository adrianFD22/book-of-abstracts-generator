\abstracttext{
    Why are you even reading this? Anyway. In this talk, I will introduce the Littleales's theorem: every person is stupid. This can be checked empirically. For instance, you are reading this abstract which does not make sense at all and, even though, you are still reading it. This proves the fact that you are stupid. Moreover, since I keep writing this thing, Im also stupid. Using this kind of arguments we can derive the same result for every person.
