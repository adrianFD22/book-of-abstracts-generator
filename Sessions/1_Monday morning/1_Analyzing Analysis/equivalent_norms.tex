\abstracttext{
    We (me and myself) generalize the result regarding the equivalence of all norms over the real numbers. By employing Absurd Calculus, we are able to prove that all norms over any vector space are equivalent. By doing this, we derived some classical results from Absurd Calculus: the derivative of any function (even the non-derivable ones) is $0$, $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x}{\sen x} = 0.44$, the derivative of any function (even the non-derivable ones) is not $0$\ldots
