\abstracttext{
    It is well known that applied mathematics often presents the most worked out drawings. The complexity of strange differential equations leads to a large variety of colored pictures with a lot of curved lines and incomprehensive arrows. Some of this pictures have an interest in themselves.

    In this talk, we (me) will put aside differential equations to focus only in the graphs they produce. We introduce a theorem relating the number of colors used in the picture and the number of "Wows" produced by the public.
